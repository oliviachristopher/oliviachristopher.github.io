  <aside>
      <p>Designed by Julieta Ulanovsky, inspired by posters and signs in the Montserrat neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. Released in 2011. In 2015, a full set of weights and italics were developed in collaboration with Ale Paul, Carolina Giovagnoli, Andrés Torresi, Juan Pablo del Peral and Sol Matas. 
        November 2017 saw another major update: The family was redrawn by Jacques Le Bailly, adjusting the weights. “Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, and Juan Pablo del Peral, led the development of Cyrillic support, with consultation with Carolina Giovagnoli, Maria Doreuli, and Alexei Vanyashin.” [Google Fonts] An Armenian version was added by Vahan Hovhannisyan.</p>

    <p><em>Let's get started by looking at non-letter characters in the typeface.</em></p>

      <p><strong>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0</strong></br> The first piece of the typeface to look at specifically are the numbers. <br>The numbers all have even base lines and are a clean and clear sans serif. </p>
    
      <p><strong>> * + & % @ ~ # ^ $ < ( )</strong></br>The next part of the typeface to look at are the special characters. <br> All of the special characters are legible and some even have varing line weight.</p>

<p><em>The next element of this typeface are slashes.</em></p>
      <p><strong>/ / / / / / / / / / / /   </strong></br>The next element in the typeface to look at is the forward slash.</p>

      <p><strong>\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ </strong></br> Now we are going to look at the backwards slash.</p>

  </div>

  <p><em>Now let's take a look at punctuation and bracets.</em></p>
      <p><strong>! ? , . ; : </strong> 
        <br>I enjoy that the punctuation is very rounded. <br>The comma has a full circle and then the tail.</p>

 
      <p><strong>{ } [ ] ( ) < > </strong> 
        <br>The bracets offer a clear and distinct look, as would best suit their purpose in writing.</p>
